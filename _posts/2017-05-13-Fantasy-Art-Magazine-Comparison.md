During a recent visit to WH Smith I came across a few interesting looking bookazines, one of which was titled "Fantasy Art 7th Edition". A quick flick through later I decided to buy the book and enjoyed reading the tutorials. 

After a while of reading I decided to see if I could purchase the other 6 books, as if they are as high quality as this then they would be a welcome addition to my bookshelf.

However after a lot of searching the net I could only seem to come across volume 1,2,3 and 7, where had issues 4,5 and 6 gone? There seemed to be no trace of their existence.

# Volume 1

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/ruva3WalLAnSS6kUEvsBHA_img_0.png)

Volume One says it is part of the "Fantasy Artist" bookazine series by Imagine Publishing.

The magazine was formally known as Digital Artist and sister title to Photoshop Creative.

# Quick Summary

* I was interested in finding out if all 7 issues of this magazine actually exist and if so where to buy them.

* Sadly it turns out there are only 3 unique ones and the rest are revised editions or re-releases of previous content.
