Rules for Clean Javascript

## Create MORE functions (rather than large functions)

* Helps with DRY

* Easier to refactor

## Use Lodash rather than custom looping code (when you can)

* Optimised for most common cases (much more optimised than underscore)

* Peer-reviewed for bugs and performance

* Creates more shareable code as long as both projects are using lodash
