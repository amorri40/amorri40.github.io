If you are like me and have multiple backups of certain folders that you need to keep up-to-date on multiple harddrives this tool will be very useful.

It is built into MacOS and called `FileMerge`.

Then find one of the folders and put it on the left and the other on the right, then click compare.

`FileMerge` will take some time to compare everything but eventually it will contain a very easy to understand comparison of the 2 folders.

Very simple tip but I find this invaluable when updating backup folders and of course keeping source code up-to-date.
