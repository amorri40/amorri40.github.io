One very useful application I have recently used is called `DisplayPad`, it allows me to work at my laptop while moving applications such as Mail over to the ipad.

I personally find this much more effective than using the built in ipad apps since more than one application can be on the screen at the same time and I can move my mouse all the way across.

I was originally using `AirDisplay` but sadly it seems to take up 100% of my CPU whenever the ipad is on rendering it unusable.

Hopefully they will fix this issue as `AirDisplay` generally seems smoother than `DisplayPad`.
