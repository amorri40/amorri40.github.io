I recently purchased a Wacom Bamboo tablet with the aim of improving my drawing skills and hopefully allowing myself to create my own custom assets for games, websites and apps rather than relying on what I can find on the web. In order to help me get the most out of my new Wacom tablet I tarted watching a number of video tutorials on the Wacom tablet. In this post I will give a brief overview of all the tutorials I watched and the main points I got out of them.

# Lynda.com Wacom Essential Training

First of all the guy (John Derry) who teaches this course is really good!

He makes it very enjoyable to watch. I generally watch these videos at 2 to 2.5 times the original speed as it helps save a little time and keeps my mind from wandering when they go over concepts I already know.

Most of this course is pretty basic and many of the videos don't apply to the limited functionality of the bamboo tablet.

The best part of this course is section 6 "Work Out with Tablet Calisthenics" where he gives a number of exercises to improve your hand-eye coordination with the Wacom tablet.

In my opinion this section alone is worth the price of the course.
I need to remember to practise using these techniques on a regular basis in order to improve my ability with the Wacom tablet.

However most of the course is designed for more advanced Wacom tablets and the other information is too basic to be worth watching.

# PhotoshopCafe Wacom Tablets and Photoshop

The first half of this course can be ignored if you are using a bamboo the information is too basic or irrelevant due to the limitations of the bamboo.

But the real benefit to this video course is in the second sections where the author demonstrates how he fixes various photographs using his tablet.

He covers using the clone-stamp tool, context-aware fill, faking depth of field using a blurred layer and mask and fixing shadows.

Overall the second part of this course is very interesting but not directly related to the Wacom tablet in my opinion, although it is useful seeing the settings in photoshop that can be controlled using pen pressure.
