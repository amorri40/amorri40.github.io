During a recent visit to WH Smith I came across a few interesting looking bookazines, one of which was titled "Fantasy Art 7th Edition". A quick flick through later I decided to buy the book and enjoyed reading the tutorials. 

After a while of reading I decided to see if I could purchase the other 6 books, as if they are as high quality as this then they would be a welcome addition to my bookshelf.

However after a lot of searching the net I could only seem to come across volume 1,2,3 and 7, where had issues 4,5 and 6 gone? There seemed to be no trace of their existence.

## Volume 1

# Quick Summary

* I was interested in finding out if all 7 issues of this magazine actually exist and if so where to buy them.

* Sadly it turns out there are only 3 unique ones and the rest are revised editions or re-releases of previous content.
